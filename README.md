#### Libraries and Tools Used:
- **Numpy**
- **Pandas**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Scipy**
- **Joblib** (for model persistence)
- **eli5** (for model explainability)
- **lime** (for interpretable machine learning)
- **neattext** (for text preprocessing)
- **altair** (for visualizations)
- **Streamlit** (for the web interface)
